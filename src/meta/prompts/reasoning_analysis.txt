6. Temporal relationships and chronology

Your analysis should:
- Integrate multiple lines of evidence

{
    "description": "Detailed interpretation of what this pattern likely represents",
    "confidence": "A value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing confidence in this being an archaeological site",
    "historical_context": "How this relates to historical records",
    "indigenous_perspective": "How this relates to indigenous knowledge",
    "recommended_next_steps": "Scientific recommendations for verification"
