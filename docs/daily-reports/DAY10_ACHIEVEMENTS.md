- **Priority-Based Filtering**: High/medium/low priority recommendations

### 2. Real-time KAN Monitoring System  
- **Live Agent Status Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of 4 KAN agents
- **Performance Dashboard**: System health, response times, interpretability scores
- **Agent Analytics**: Individual performance with accuracy tracking
- **Live Updates**: 2-second refresh intervals

### 3. Cultural Context Visualization
- **Region-Specific Data**: Upper Xingu, Andean Highland, Lower Amazon contexts
- **Temporal Framework**: Historical periods with cultural significance scoring
- **Traditional Practices**: Active, historical, and reconstructed practices
- **Indigenous Knowledge**: Community-based cultural information
