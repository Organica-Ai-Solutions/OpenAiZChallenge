# 🔧 ICON IMPORT FIXES - RUNTIME ERROR RESOLUTION

## 🚨 **RUNTIME ERRORS RESOLVED**

### **Problem:**
Multiple runtime errors were occurring due to missing icon imports in the map page:
- `Error: Target is not defined`
- `Error: Users is not defined`
- Additional icons causing potential crashes

### **Root Cause:**
When we enhanced the bottom bar tabs with advanced NIS Protocol features, we added many new icons but forgot to import them from `lucide-react`.

## ✅ **ICONS ADDED TO IMPORTS:**

```typescript
import {
