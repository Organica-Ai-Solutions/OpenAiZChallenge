# Variable Initialization Error Fix Summary

## Issue Description
**Error**: `Uncaught Error: Cannot access 'webSearchResults' before initialization at ArchaeologicalMapPage (page.tsx:1104:7)`

## Root Cause
The `EnhancedSiteCard` component was trying to access state variables (`webSearchResults`, `siteAnalysisResults`, `deepResearchResults`) that were declared later in the file, causing a temporal dead zone error.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Moved State Variable Declarations
- **Original location**: Lines 4308-4310 (after component definition)
- **New location**: Lines 158-160 (before component definition)

### 2. Removed Duplicate Declarations
- Eliminated duplicate state variable declarations that were causing linter errors
- Ensured single source of truth for each state variable

### 3. Code Changes Made
```typescript
// Enhanced analysis results state - moved up for component access
const [siteAnalysisResults, setSiteAnalysisResults] = useState<Record<string, any>>({})
const [webSearchResults, setWebSearchResults] = useState<Record<string, any>>({})
const [deepResearchResults, setDeepResearchResults] = useState<Record<string, any>>({})
```

## Files Modified
- `frontend/app/map/page.tsx` - Moved state variable declarations to proper location

## Impact
- ✅ Fixed runtime error preventing page load
- ✅ Enhanced site cards now have access to analysis results
- ✅ Web search and deep research functionality now properly accessible
- ✅ NIS Protocol backend integration maintains functionality

## Technical Details
The issue occurred because JavaScript hoisting doesn't apply to `const` declarations in the same way as `var` declarations. The `EnhancedSiteCard` component defined at line 5080 was trying to access variables declared at line 4308, creating a temporal dead zone error.

By moving the state declarations earlier in the component (to lines 158-160), all subsequent code including the `EnhancedSiteCard` component can properly access these variables.

## Testing Status
- State variables now properly initialized before component definition
- Runtime error resolved
- Enhanced site analysis functionality maintained
- NIS Protocol backend integration preserved
