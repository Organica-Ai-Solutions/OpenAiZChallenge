## üîß **Required System Modifications**

### **1. OpenAI Model Integration** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
Current system uses custom agents - must integrate OpenAI models:

```python
# New OpenAI Integration Module
class OpenAIArchaeologyAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.gpt4_client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
        self.o3_client = OpenAI(model="o3-mini")
    
    async def analyze_satellite_imagery(self, coordinates, imagery_data):
        """Use GPT-4.1 Vision for satellite analysis"""
        
    async def generate_archaeological_hypothesis(self, evidence):
        """Use o3-mini for reasoning and hypothesis generation"""
        
    async def correlate_historical_data(self, location, historical_texts):
        """Use GPT-4.1 for historical context analysis"""
```
