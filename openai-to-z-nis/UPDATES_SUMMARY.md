# NIS Protocol Project Updates

## Summary of Enhancements

Based on extensive research into the NIS (Neuro-Inspired System) Protocol architecture and best practices for archaeological site discovery, the following enhancements have been implemented:

### 1. Frontend Improvements

- **Fixed Package Compatibility Issues**
  - Updated `date-fns` from v3.0.0 to v2.30.0 to ensure compatibility with `react-day-picker` v8.10.1
  - Specified fixed versions for `leaflet` and `react-leaflet` to prevent dependency issues

- **Added Interactive Map Functionality**
  - Created a new `MapView.tsx` component using react-leaflet to display discovered sites
  - Implemented dynamic marker placement for archaeological sites
  - Added popup information windows for site details
  - Added support for both light and dark map themes

- **Enhanced UI/UX**
  - Updated the results display to show more comprehensive information
  - Added sections for historical context, indigenous perspective, and recommendations
  - Improved the interface for data source selection

### 2. Backend Architecture Enhancements

- **NIS Protocol Implementation**
  - Created a complete MetaProtocolCoordinator implementation (`src/meta/coordinator.py`)
  - Implemented three protocol adapters:
    - MCP (Managed Compute Protocol) for external service calls
    - ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) for structured agent function calls
    - A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol) for direct peer-to-peer agent messaging

- **Agent Communication Framework**
  - Enhanced the `action_agent.py` to support MetaProtocol integration
  - Improved recommendation generation with specialized recommendations based on pattern type
  - Added support for the two independent verification methods requirement

- **Pipeline Processing**
  - Implemented a pipeline-based approach for agent coordination
  - Added context preservation between agent calls
  - Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 3. Documentation and Deployment

- **Created Comprehensive Documentation**
  - Detailed project README with setup instructions
  - Architecture diagrams and explanations
  - Usage guidelines and troubleshooting tips

- **Deployment Improvements**
  - Added convenience batch script (`run_all.bat`) for Windows users
  - Created proper directory structure for organized codebase
  - Ensured compatibility with both local development and deployment environments

## Implementation Details

### MetaProtocolCoordinator

The MetaProtocolCoordinator serves as the central orchestrator for all agent interactions, implementing the NIS Protocol architecture. Key features include:

- **Protocol Registration**: Allows registering different protocol adapters
- **Agent Registration**: Maintains a registry of available agents
- **Message Routing**: Routes messages between agents using the appropriate protocol
- **Context Memory**: Stores and retrieves data between agent calls
- **Pipeline Execution**: Runs sequences of agent calls as pipelines
- **Task History**: Maintains a history of all agent interactions for transparency

### Enhanced Agent Capabilities

Agents have been extended to support the NIS Protocol architecture:

- **Vision Agent**: Processes satellite and LIDAR data to detect potential archaeological features
- **Memory Agent**: Stores and retrieves contextual information to inform reasoning
- **Reasoning Agent**: Uses GPT-4.1 to analyze findings in historical and cultural context
- **Action Agent**: Generates comprehensive reports and targeted recommendations

### Frontend-Backend Integration

The frontend and backend are now seamlessly integrated through:

- **RESTful API**: The `/api/analyze` endpoint orchestrates the full NIS Protocol pipeline
- **Interactive Map**: Results are displayed on an interactive map for easy exploration
- **Detailed Results**: Comprehensive display of findings, context, and recommendations

## Future Work

While significant improvements have been made, several areas could benefit from further enhancement:

1. **AI Model Integration**: Direct integration with WALDO and other specialized CV models
2. **Kafka Streaming**: Implementation of Kafka for truly asynchronous agent communication
3. **Vector Search**: Integration of a vector database for more sophisticated Memory Agent functionality
4. **Multi-Area Analysis**: Support for analyzing multiple areas simultaneously
5. **Overlay Generation**: Automated generation of overlay images combining satellite and LIDAR data
